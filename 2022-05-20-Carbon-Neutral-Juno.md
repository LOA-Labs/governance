## **Juno Network: A Carbon Neutral Protocol?**

The global movement to address climate change is stronger than ever. Driven by real time ecological disasters, near daily red flag warnings from scientists, highly motivated governments and businesses seeking to mitigate climate change impacts, we are at a pivotal moment in human history.

[LOA Labs](https://loalabs.io/) has focused worked at the intersection of crypto and climate since 2017 and is supporting the expansive growth of the regenerative finance movement (#ReFi). We work daily to help those protocols express their ‘better world’ visions and values.

As a proud validator for Juno Network, LOA Labs is seeking to add value to the protocol and community as an emerging home for values-driven projects and activities. To that end, we are gathering community feedback on a potential proposal that would allow Juno Network protocol, launched in October 2021, to go carbon neutral since its inception. 


### **The problem**

An excess of carbon dioxide and related greenhouse gasses is a clear and present danger to the stability of our climate. Individuals, organizations and businesses all have a responsibility to mitigate the impact of their operations as it relates to their carbon footprint. 

Additionally, the blockchain industry has been heavily criticized for its excessive carbon footprint. While proof of stake protocols like Juno have far less climate impacts than proof of work, the impact is still substantive and, more importantly, addressable.

On a related note, global regulators are taking aim at corporations to address their carbon footprint.  As an example - [ SEC Proposes Rules to Enhance and Standardize Climate-Related Disclosures for Investors](https://www.sec.gov/news/press-release/2022-46)**<span style="text-decoration:underline;">: </span>**

**Carbon emission is the primary cause of global warming and climate change. Blockchain-related activities and the IT industry reportedly account for carbon emissions up to 3.7% of the total global emissions of 36bn tonnes. ([source](https://earthstate.ixo.world/zero-emission-blockchain/) )**

Beyond the climate crisis as a driver for taking action, Web3 through the framework of Regenerative Finance (#ReFi), is positioning blockchain to be one of the more exciting and powerful tools for addressing climate change head-on.

Already protocols like KlimaDAO, Toucan and Regen Network have made headlines for their ability to help fundamentally value carbon assets and create web3 based finance tools to introduce these new financial asset classes into the crypto economy.

**ZERO Carbon Commitment:**

Recently, a consortium of Cosmos-focused protocols including ixo, Regen Network and other Cosmos entities have assembled under the [ZERO Carbon Commitment](https://earthstate.ixo.world/zero/) to assist protocols and validators with offsetting their carbon footprint. 




 

Already, [Osmosis](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/osmosis/governance?detailId=176), Cheqd, [Stargaze ](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/stargaze/governance?detailId=25)and [ixo](https://wallet.keplr.app/#/impacthub/governance?detailId=11) communities have voted to go carbon neutral or carbon negative. We hope Juno will be next.  



**Juno Network Carbon Footprint (estimated) & Governance Proposal**

Juno has the ability, for a relatively modest cost, to completely offset its carbon footprint through purchasing and retiring carbon credits (nature-based carbon credits) verified by leading standards bodies. 

Based on [assessments by Regen Network](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1H-w4dBc1Svcmw_fzEKUFRgK_pga1qsGMHCTsUKUmWEA/edit?usp=sharing), it is estimated that Juno Network’s carbon footprint stands at 4325 tons / year under the ‘worst case’ scenario with extrapolation of information from regen network validators, applied to validator scales of Cosmos based networks. By purchase and retirement of 4325 nature based carbon credits from Regen Network, the Juno carbon footprint can be offset allowing Juno protocol to be officially ‘carbon neutral’ for the time of October 30, 2021 - October 31, 2022 

LOA Labs Validator - Governance proposal draft language: 



> Voting YES to this proposal indicates approval to address Juno's carbon emissions footprint by purchasing 1 year worth of carbon credits at worst case projections through Regen Network

> Voting NO to this proposal indicates that this funding should not be allocated.

> Based on feedback from carbon footprint data reported by validators of Regen Network, Juno Network is projected to emit at most 4325 tons a year in carbon, negatively affecting our climate.

> This proposal requests to spend $39,280 worth of Juno to purchase 3928 cNCTs ($10/credit), to allow Juno to become carbon neutral from October 2021 - October 2022.

> Any funding that remains post-purchase due to price fluctuations of NCT will be returned to the Community Pool. 


Thank you for considering this governance proposal. We are bullish on Juno Network and excited to contribute to this vibrant community.  Stay tuned for more impact projects emerging from LOA Labs within the Juno community.
